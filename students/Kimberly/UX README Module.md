#User Experience Module

For this module, I worked on re-designing [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/) which is an online anime/manga community. I wanted to make the social aspect more revelant on the site as it didn't look like it had an active community.

##Research:
* One of the things that I did was to use [archive.org/web/](http://archive.org/web/) to take note of any changes MAL had through the years to understand what needs may had changed through the years and take those into account. Find screenshots and notes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b37u8u7ewxymndx/AAB1dvOfu5QcJnyXoiePloy_a?dl=0)

* These User Personas are based on my interviews and their names and pictures are fake to keep them anonymous [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pb0a5vi2vtqak45/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-14%20at%2013.41.23.png?dl=0), [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1x1xki3nsij0ez/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-14%20at%2013.41.31.png?dl=0) & [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wzddg6faxr1n651/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-14%20at%2013.41.39.png?dl=0)
